| Area                           | Description / Recommendation                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scalable Queueing**          | Use a message broker (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, Redis Streams) to queue and distribute work to LLM service instances, avoiding overload and improving throughput. |
| **Load Balancing**             | Run multiple instances of the LLM microservice behind a load balancer (e.g., NGINX, Traefik) to horizontally scale handling.                                   |
| **Rate Limiting & Throttling** | Protect LLM API usage with rate limiting, so you donâ€™t hit provider quota limits. Can be built into the API gateway or the microservice itself.                |
| **Centralized API Gateway**    | Expose a single API endpoint (FastAPI) to workers, with authentication, monitoring, and metrics.                                                               |
| **Advanced Cache**             | Move from file cache to distributed cache like Redis for concurrent access and expiry control.                                                                 |
| **Monitoring & Alerting**      | Setup logs aggregation, metrics (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana), and alerting on failures, latency, and API quota usage.                                           |
| **Security**                   | Secure API keys, add authentication & authorization for API access. Use secrets manager and environment variables securely.                                    |
| **Autoscaling**                | Use container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm) with autoscaling based on CPU, memory, or queue length.                                                 |

```bash 
[Worker Nodes] --> [API Gateway/Load Balancer] --> [LLM Microservice Instances]
                                  |                       |
                                Redis                    Redis
                               (Queue & Cache)          (Cache)
```
